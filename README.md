# Cloth Simulation

For our CS123 Final Project, we made a simulation of a cloth falling. Our simulation supports collision with a sphere, a hole, and the ground. It also supports wind. 

Our GUI has parameters to modify: 
* tessellation
* constraint (number of particles a particle is acted upon by).
* texture image
* wind
* clipping (clip one or two of the cloth's corners in place)
* sphere, hole, or neither

Every time a parameter is modified, the simulation automatically restarts.
